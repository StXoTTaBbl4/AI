I'm 12 years old and I want to try playing with new characters.
I like female heroic characters.
I like the healer role.
I want to play something medium.
I want the character to be at least aa tier.
I want to play a character that was released in 2016.
I’m not interested in the character’s story.
As for species, I prefer human.
I'm not ready to spend time or money on unlocking a character.
